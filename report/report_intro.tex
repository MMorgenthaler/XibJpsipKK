\section{Introduction}
\noindent
In the Standard Model of particle physics baryons are hadrons consisting out of three quarks. Theoretically baryons with more quarks for example five, called pentaquarks, and six, called hexaquarks are possible. Those exotic baryons were first observed in 2015, as the LHCb collaboration discovered the two pentaquarks $P^+_c(4380)$ and $P^+_c(4450)$\cite{PhysRevLett.115.072001}.

To prepare for further work on the \S0 an approximation method for it's mass is studied. It's the same approximation Julian Bollig used in his studies \ref{Bollig_2018}The decay channel we were currently most interested in is \HexaDecay. The problem is that there is no comparative data to compare the approximated mass to. As such an extremely similar decay channel \XibmDecay was studied instead. In this study the two kaons were used as a substitute for the \S0 and we assumed that they are not detectable.
